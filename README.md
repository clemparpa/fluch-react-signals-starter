Opinionated React 19 SPA template — **Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 + shadcn (Base UI variant) + @preact/signals-react + React Router 7**.

Built as a fork-friendly starting point for AI-driven UI work: signals replace most `useState` boilerplate, shadcn components are vendored under `src/components/ui`, and CI blocks merges on lint / typecheck / test / audit / build.

## Quickstart

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev          # http://localhost:5173 — opens on /showcase
```

Requires **Node ≥ 22** and **pnpm ≥ 9** (versions pinned via [.nvmrc](.nvmrc) and `packageManager` in [package.json](package.json)).

```

## Signals

`@preact/signals-react` is wired through a Babel plugin (`@preact/signals-react-transform`) so components react to signal reads **without** needing the `useSignals()` hook. See [vite.config.ts](vite.config.ts) for the plugin order — `babel` must run **before** `react`.

```tsx
import { signal } from "@preact/signals-react"

const count = signal(0)

export function Counter() {
  return <button onClick={() => count.value++}>{count}</button>
}
```

## State management

For state that goes beyond a single isolated signal, the template ships [`@fluch/signal-store`](skills/@fluch-signal-store/SKILL.md) — a small (~3 kb gzip), fully typed lib built on Preact signals. Stores are composed from features (`withState` + `withComputed` + `withMethods`) and exposed as fine-grained signals — no Provider, no hook, no selectors.

`@preact/signals-react` gives you raw fine-grained reactivity (above). `@fluch/signal-store` is the **composition layer on top**: it groups related signals, derives computed values, and bundles synchronous mutations behind named methods. Both cohabit — use signals for one-off reactive cells, the store for cohesive state.

```ts
import { computed } from "@preact/signals-core"
import { patchState, signalStore, withComputed, withMethods, withState } from "@fluch/signal-store"

export const counter = signalStore(
  withState({ count: 0 }),
  withComputed(({ count }) => ({ double: computed(() => count.value * 2) })),
  withMethods((s) => ({ increment: () => patchState(s, { count: s.count.value + 1 }) })),
)
```

In-tree example: [src/stores/counter.ts](src/stores/counter.ts) + [src/pages/showcase/sections/signal-store.tsx](src/pages/showcase/sections/signal-store.tsx) (live demo on `/showcase`). Going further → [skills/@fluch-signal-store/SKILL.md](skills/@fluch-signal-store/SKILL.md) for the core API, plus `references/` for normalized entity collections, scoped React Provider, RxJS side-effects (`rxMethod`), and the Redux DevTools bridge.

## Authentication

The template ships the **client** for [better-auth](https://better-auth.com) — sign-in / sign-up / session — but **not the server**. The `/auth` page (see [src/pages/auth.tsx](src/pages/auth.tsx)) is a working demo that points at whatever backend you configure via `VITE_AUTH_BASE_URL`.

```sh
cp .env.example .env
# then edit .env to point at a running better-auth backend, e.g.:
# VITE_AUTH_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

Without a backend, `/auth` still renders — it just shows a red alert banner ("No auth backend configured") and the network requests fail (expected). See [better-auth.com](https://better-auth.com) for how to stand up a compatible server.

The client lives in [src/lib/auth-client.ts](src/lib/auth-client.ts) and re-exports the hooks (`useSession`) and actions (`signIn`, `signUp`, `signOut`) you'll typically import from your pages.

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs five parallel jobs on every push to `main` and every pull request:

- `lint` — Biome
- `typecheck` — TypeScript
- `test` — Vitest
- `audit` — `pnpm audit --audit-level=high`
- `build` — full production build

Concurrency is set so that a new commit on the same ref cancels the previous run.

## Specs & roadmap

- [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) — full template specification
- [STORIES.md](STORIES.md) — the eleven user stories that produced this repo
- [designs/active.md](designs/active.md) — placeholder for the active design system (overwritten by the `apply-theme` skill)

## Fork this template

This repo is published as a **GitHub template** — click *Use this template* (or `gh repo create --template …`) to start a new project from it. After cloning your fork:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

…and start replacing the showcase page with your own routes.

## Monorepo integration

When integrating this template as a workspace inside an existing monorepo:

1. **Move the source** into your monorepo path, e.g. `apps/front/`.
2. **Adjust [.github/dependabot.yml](.github/dependabot.yml)**: change `directories: ["/"]` to your package path (e.g. `directories: ["/apps/front"]`). If your monorepo already has a `github-actions` entry from another template, keep only one — Dependabot scans `.github/workflows/` repo-wide.
3. **Merge CI workflows**: this template's `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs 5 jobs scoped to a single project. In a monorepo you'll likely want to gate jobs on path filters (`paths: ["apps/front/**"]`) or restructure into a matrix.
4. **Lockfile**: pnpm workspaces use a single root `pnpm-lock.yaml` — Dependabot handles this natively. Point `directories` at the package, not the lockfile.
